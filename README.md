#The MLB Showdown Statistics Project

Goal: Put statistical rigor behind the creation of MLB Showdown cards - create an MLB Showdown set that plays as true-to-life as possible.

How does it work? *Right now it takes some coding knowledge :)*

<ul>
<li> `formula.php` is the master script. This outputs info on what player cards will look like. It is not very user friendly yet though. It might not ever be. But it will be usable.</li>
<li> It uses `data` from historical cards as well as MLB season statistics. See the `.sql` files with valid syntax.</li>
<li> `sites` contains the code for a game simulater </li>
</ul>

Why in the world are you using php on the command line? *Because I wanted to, and it works. Don't hate.*

#### About the game itself
In a nutshell: Play a game of baseball with a 20 sided die and special trading cards.
