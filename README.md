#The MLB Showdown Statistics Project

Creating MLB Showdown sets that play as true-to-life as possible.

<ul>
<li> `formula.php` is the master script. This outputs MLB Showdown card charts based on actual season statistics.</li>
<li> `data` is compiled from existing Showdown cards as well as MLB season statistics.</li>
<li> `statsim` contains the code for an in-browser game simulator *(soon to be hosted)*</li>
</ul>

Why in the world are you using php on the command line? *Because at one point I wanted to, and it works.*

#### About the game itself
Play a game of baseball with trading cards. In a nutshell: Roll a 20 sided die twice to determine the result of an at-bat.
